⍝ Fires up Dyalog APL & loads a workspace DLGTEST which then creates a component file
⍝ (exclusively tied) and shows a dialog. That app is allowed to run as long as it wants,
⍝ and to have it's own Window.
⍝ The test case tries to tie the very same component file. When that
⍝ does not fail (because the app was closed down by a human being by then) the file is
⍝ checked for existing. If it doesn't that's supposed to be fine because the DLGTEST ws
⍝ will delete that component file before exiting.
⍝ That's supposed to work because the dialogue displayed by DLGTEST is shutdown down
⍝ by a timer aftyer some time.
